#Building an advanced tinywl system

Tasks Done: 

-Cloning of this repository and resolving all the existing path issues.
-Cloning multiple unavailable libraries and linking with the main file and directories/path.
-Replication and documentation.
-Execution of multiple windows in a tinyWL compositor(stacking).
-Editing Maximize and minimizing code to make it work.
-Execution of Tiling behavior, with auto positioning differently both in case of single window(centralization) and adjacent stacking in case of multiple windows.
-Making a dynamic storage structure to handle the position and size of the windows in case of multiple windows, and using it to miminize the windows.
-Execution of an advanced function of snapping with pixel proximity check and time after the windows are in proximity.
-Opening of windows inside tinyWL compositor without being required to write explicit command for those apps.

Next task: 

-Some error in the snapping function, because of which, sometimes windows are overlapping by some pixels.
-Opening of windows inside the tinyWL compositor thru some good visual display of all the apps visible.
