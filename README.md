# Building an Advanced TinyWL System

### Tasks Completed
- Successfully cloned the repository and resolved all existing path issues.
- Cloned multiple unavailable libraries and linked them with the main files and directories.
- Replicated the setup and documented the process thoroughly.
- Implemented functionality to execute multiple windows in the TinyWL compositor with stacking behavior.
- Edited and fixed the maximize and minimize code to ensure proper functionality.
- Achieved tiling behavior with automatic positioning: centralized positioning for a single window and adjacent stacking for multiple windows.
- Developed a dynamic storage structure to manage the position and size of windows, enabling proper minimization functionality.
- Implemented an advanced snapping feature with pixel proximity checks and timing adjustments when windows come into proximity.
- Enabled windows to open inside the TinyWL compositor without requiring explicit commands for those applications.
- Integration of **Rofi** within the TinyWL compositor by implementation of **layer_shell_protocol** from scratch.
-  Integration of two other protocols - foreign_toplevel_management protocol and DMA_BUF protocol.


### Next Tasks
- Fix an issue in the snapping function where windows occasionally overlap by a few pixels.
- Enhance the visual display of all apps within the TinyWL compositor, enabling better interaction and navigation when opening windows.
